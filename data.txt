BEATRICE

    'Then' is spoken; fare you well now: and yet, ere
    I go, let me go with that I came; which is, with
    knowing what hath passed between you and Claudio.

BENEDICK

    Only foul words; and thereupon I will kiss thee.

BEATRICE

    Foul words is but foul wind, and foul wind is but
    foul breath, and foul breath is noisome; therefore I
    will depart unkissed.

BENEDICK

    Thou hast frighted the word out of his right sense,
    so forcible is thy wit. But I must tell thee
    plainly, Claudio undergoes my challenge; and either
    I must shortly hear from him, or I will subscribe
    him a coward. And, I pray thee now, tell me for
    which of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love with me?

BEATRICE

    For them all together; which maintained so politic
    a state of evil that they will not admit any good
    part to intermingle with them. But for which of my
    good parts did you first suffer love for me?

BENEDICK

    Suffer love! a good epithet! I do suffer love
    indeed, for I love thee against my will.

BEATRICE

    In spite of your heart, I think; alas, poor heart!
    If you spite it for my sake, I will spite it for
    yours; for I will never love that which my friend hates.

BENEDICK

    Thou and I are too wise to woo peaceably.

BEATRICE

    It appears not in this confession: there's not one
    wise man among twenty that will praise himself.

BENEDICK

    An old, an old instance, Beatrice, that lived in
    the lime of good neighbours. If a man do not erect
    in this age his own tomb ere he dies, he shall live
    no longer in monument than the bell rings and the
    widow weeps.
